      <h1>What is Ruby? And Rails?</h1>
<h4>by Daniel Kehoe</h4>
<p><em>Last updated 23 February 2013</em></p>
<p>What is Ruby on Rails? Introduces Rails—and key concepts—to a Rails beginner.</p>
<p>Getting started learning Rails? See recommendations for a <a href="https://tutorials.railsapps.org/rails-tutorial">Rails tutorial</a> to suit your skill level and learning style.</p>
<h2>Ruby on Rails</h2>
<p>Ruby is a programming language.</p>
<p>Rails (also known as Ruby on Rails) is a software library (a “gem,” short for <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rubygem">RubyGem</a>) that extends the Ruby programming language. It is used as a framework for building websites. Rails establishes organizational conventions that allow any experienced Rails developer to analyze and understand the workings of a complex website, making collaboration and maintenance easier. Rails combines the Ruby programming language with <span class="caps">HTML</span>, <span class="caps">CSS</span>, and JavaScript to create a “web application” that runs on a web server. Thus, Rails is a server-side, or “back end,” web application development platform.</p>
<p>In a larger sense, Rails is more than a RubyGem used to build websites. Rails is at the center of a large community that collaborates to produce software libraries (again, “gems”) that make it possible to build complex websites with features such as databases, signing up and logging on users, and credit card transactions. Community members share core values, often use the same tools, and support each other with an informal network that largely depends on volunteerism. Overlapping the informal community is an economic network that includes jobs, recruiters, consulting firms, conferences, infrastructure services, businesses that build websites with Rails, and investors that fund startups. The large pool of open source gems and the embrace of Rails by many sought-after software engineers has resulted in Rails becoming particularly popular among technology startups.</p>
<h2>Why Ruby?</h2>
<p>In a podcast from <a href="http://thisdeveloperslife.com/post/1-0-5-homerun">This Developer’s Life</a>, David Heinemeier Hansson, the creator of Rails, describes his frustration with a lack of abstraction and a tendency to repetitive code in the <span class="caps">PHP</span> programming language he used when he began building an online project management website named BaseCamp in 2004. He liked the software enginering abstractions supported in the Java programming language but got excited about the ease of use (he calls it pleasure) he found in the Ruby language.</p>
<p>Ruby is known among programmers for a terse, uncluttered syntax that doesn’t require a lot of extra punctuation. Compared to Java, Ruby is streamlined, with less code required to create basic structures such as data fields. Ruby is a relatively advanced language that makes it easy to use high-level programming techniques (such as “closures” and metaprogramming). In particular, metaprogramming makes it easy to develop a “domain specific language” that customizes Ruby for a particular set of uses (Rails and many gems use this “<span class="caps">DSL</span>” capability).</p>
<p>Ruby’s key advantage is RubyGems, the package manager that makes it easy to create and share software libraries (gems) that extend Ruby. RubyGems provides a simple system to install gems. Anyone can upload a new gem to the central <a href="https://rubygems.org/">RubyGems website</a>, making the gem immediately available for installation. It is where you’ll obtain the most recent version of Rails. And it is where you will obtain all the gems that help you build complex websites.</p>
<p>Ruby has several disadvantages (at least when programmers want to argue). Its processing performance is slow relative to C++ or Java. The execution speed of a language is seldom important, though, relative to the benefits gained by programmer productivity and the general level of performance delivered by most websites. For websites that require lots of simultaneous activity, Ruby is not well-suited to the high-level software engineering required to execute simultaneous activity efficiently (standard Ruby lacks “parallelism”, though some versions support it). Lastly, some programmers complain that Ruby programs (and especially Rails) contain “too much magic” (that is, complex operations that are hidden behind simple directives). These concerns haven’t stopped Rails from becoming a popular web development platform.</p>
<h2>Do You Need to Study Ruby to Learn Rails?</h2>
<p>You may hear advice that one should study Ruby (the programming language) before attempting to use Rails to build websites. In fact, whether you study Ruby or not, you’ll likely become a skilled Rails developer before you become a skilled Ruby programmer. That’s because Rails is largely a “domain specific language” that has its own set of directives distinct from the Ruby core. You’ll be using the Ruby language syntax but you’ll largely be using the Rails “language.”</p>
<p>To avoid feeing overwhelmed when you first begin learning Rails, it is advisable to spend an hour or two with an introduction to Ruby so you are comfortable with the syntax of the language. You should be prepared to recognize what’s correctly formatted when you type Ruby code in your text editor. You can find several good online tutorials listed on the <a href="http://railsapps.github.com/ruby-and-rails.html">Ruby and Rails</a> resource page. Get started with a quick lesson from <a href="http://rubymonk.com/">RubyMonk</a> or <a href="http://tryruby.org/">Try Ruby</a>.</p>
<p>Rest assured that you will indeed begin to learn Ruby as you develop proficiency with Rails. Your hardest challenge will be to learn the names of the structures you see in code examples. This is why it is helpful to work your way through a short introduction to Ruby. You’ll need to be able to recognize when you are looking at an array or a hash. You should recognize when you are looking at an iterator or the Ruby block syntax. Eventually, you’ll recognize more exotic Ruby formulations such as the lambda. It is okay if you can’t write a lambda function or even know when to use one; many Rails developers start work before learning Ruby so well.</p>
<p>As experienced Rails developers, we hope you will make an effort to learn Ruby concurrently (or at least in parallel) as you learn Rails. Don’t be lazy; when you encounter a bit of Ruby you don’t understand, make an effort to find out what is going on. Spend time with a Ruby textbook or interactive course as you get more proficient with Rails. By all means, if you love the precision and order of programming languages, dive into the study of Ruby from the beginning. But don’t delay starting Rails while you learn Ruby; realistically, you’ll retain more knowledge of Ruby if you learn it as you build things in Rails.</p>
<h2>Relationship to <span class="caps">HTML</span>, <span class="caps">CSS</span>, and JavaScript</h2>
<p>A web browser is a program that runs on a computer and combines three kinds of files — <span class="caps">HTML</span>, <span class="caps">CSS</span>, and JavaScript — to display web pages. A browser obtains the files from a web server. The web server can be remote (connected by the Internet) or on your own computer (when you are doing development).</p>
<p>In an “Introduction to Web Design” class, you might learn to create <span class="caps">HTML</span>, <span class="caps">CSS</span>, and JavaScript files. <span class="caps">HTML</span> (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML">HyperText Markup Language</a>) is a convention for creating structured documents that combine content (such as text, images, or video) with typographic, layout and design elements (such as headlines and tables). <span class="caps">CSS</span> (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cascading_Style_Sheets">Cascading Style Sheets</a>) directives apply a specific appearance to typographic, layout and design elements. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaScript">JavaScript</a> is a programming language supported by all web browsers that is used to manipulate <span class="caps">HTML</span> and <span class="caps">CSS</span> elements, particularly for implementing interactive features such as tabs and modal windows.</p>
<p>Web servers deliver <span class="caps">HTML</span>, <span class="caps">CSS</span>, and JavaScript, either from static files that are stored on the server, or from an “application server” that creates files dynamically using a programming language such as <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ruby_(programming_language)">Ruby</a>. Rails provides an application server that uses Ruby to assemble <span class="caps">HTML</span>, <span class="caps">CSS</span>, and JavaScript files from component files (often adding content from a database). A software program written in Ruby and organized using Rails conventions is a “web application.”</p>
<p>A web browser needs only a single <span class="caps">HTML</span> file to display a web page (<span class="caps">CSS</span> and JavaScript files are optional). However, if you are creating several web pages, it often makes sense to assemble the <span class="caps">HTML</span> file from smaller components. For example, you might make a small file that will be included on every page to make a footer (Rails calls these “partials”). Consider another example: If you are displaying content from a database, you might not want the complex programming code that accesses the database mixed into your <span class="caps">HTML</span> (programmers call this <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Separation_of_concerns">separation of concerns</a> and it makes for more modular, maintainable programs).</p>
<h2>What is Rails?</h2>
<p>Let’s consider how a web application can be organized. You’ll see that a web application actually is organized in more than one way.</p>
<h3>Web Browser’s Perspective</h3>
<p>First, from the perspective of the web browser there are <span class="caps">HTML</span>, <span class="caps">CSS</span>, and JavaScript files that make up a single web page. These files are generated dynamically by your web application so you can’t see them on the server side but you can view these files by using the web developer tools that are built in to every browser (choose the menu item “Web Developer Tools” in Google Chrome or “Web Developer Toolbar” in Firefox).</p>
<h3>Coder’s Perspective</h3>
<p>On the computer you are using to develop your web application, you will be able to see a set of files that are organized in your filesystem with a structure dictated by Rails. These are the files you will edit with your text editor to create your web application. The structure is the same for every Rails application; this commonality is what makes it easy to collaborate with other Rails developers. To use Rails, you must learn about this structure and the purpose of each of the folders and files.</p>
<p>Here is how Rails files are organized:</p>
<pre>
+-app
| +-assets
| | +-images
| | +-javascripts
| | +-stylesheets
| +-controllers
| +-helpers
| +-mailers
| +-models
| +-views
+-config
+-db
+-features
+-lib
+-log
+-public
+-script
+-spec
</pre>
<p>The Rails file structure exists for the convenience of developers. “Assets” such as images, <span class="caps">CSS</span> stylesheet files, and JavaScript files get their own folders. Other folders are a place for configuration files (“config”) and testing files (“features” and “spec”) As you investigate the Rails file structure, you’ll see other folders that don’t have an evident purpose. For example, the folders for “controllers,” “models,” and “views” are important but may not have an obvious function. These folders correspond to a more abstract organizational system, one imposed by software architecture.</p>
<h3>Software Architect’s Perspective</h3>
<p>Software developers use text editors to create files that become a web application; the files are organized into folders that conform to a structure required by Rails; but the contents of the files (particularly the files written in the Ruby language) are organized according to a higher level abstraction we call “software architecture.” Software is purely conceptual; it takes shape as text files but it comes into being in the mind of programmers. Aside from certain features that are required by computer design (programs must read strings of characters from filesystems), a software program can be a conceptual abstraction that is absolutely unique to the mind of its creator. In practice, most programming languages impose a standard set of abstractions that reflect the common needs of most programmers. We keep lists with an abstraction we call an array; we perform an operation on each element of an array with an abstraction we call an iterator. Every programming language documents these basic abstractions in a language reference (for example, see the <a href="http://www.ruby-doc.org/">Ruby <span class="caps">API</span></a>).</p>
<p>In Ruby (as in many other <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object-oriented_programming">object-oriented</a> languages), an “object” is the fundamental abstraction which is the basis for all other abstractions. Ruby tutorials say, “In Ruby, everything is an object,” and then show that all objects have <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_(computer_science)">state</a> (data or “attributes”), behavior (procedures or “methods”), and identity (unique existence among all other objects). Objects are described with a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Class_(computer_programming)">class</a> definition that describes attributes and methods; objects are used by a program as <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instance_(computer_science)">instances</a> that have identical methods but differing data. Ruby provides a standard syntax for defining classes, creating instances, and calling methods.</p>
<p>At a higher level of abstraction, programmers find that code can be often be optimally organized according to patterns that other experienced developers will recognize. Code is easier to write when it fits a pattern you’ve encountered before; it’s easier to analyze and understand code that another programmer has written if it matches a widely known <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_pattern">software design pattern</a>. One example is the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model%E2%80%93View%E2%80%93Controller">Model–view–controller</a> pattern that is fundamental to organizing Rails applications. Though the <span class="caps">MVC</span> pattern is enshrined in the file structure of a Rails application, it also exists in the form of a hierarchy of Rails classes, notably the ActionController, the ActionView, and the ActiveRecord model. From the perspective of a software architect, a Rails web application is organized in a structure defined by the <a href="http://api.rubyonrails.org/">Rails <span class="caps">API</span></a>.</p>
<h3>Time Traveler’s Perspective</h3>
<p>So far, we’ve seen how a web application is organized from the perspective of a web browser, the filesystem, and software architecture. There’s a temporal perspective that is just as important. A web application is developed over time; often we make mistakes and need to roll back to a previous version of our work. Computers are data storage machines as much as they are machines for manipulating or communicating data. However, the original concept of a computer file system didn’t allow for travel backward in time; files in disk storage preserve only the most recent version of your work. As programmers, we’ve had to add <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Revision_control">version control systems</a> (sometimes known as revision control or source control systems) to recover earlier versions of our work.</p>
<p>There are several popular revision control systems; <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Git_(software)">git</a> is used most often by Rails developers. The metaphor of computer folders and files is easy to understand, at least for people who have worked where 20th century office supplies are still used. Git doesn’t offer any similar real-world metaphor which means it is much more difficult to understand how it works. Nonetheless, you must learn to use git if you intend to build more than the simplest Rails application.</p>
<p>Superficially, you can think of git as a series of snapshots of the your project’s filesystem. You can save a snapshot at any time with a “git commit” command in the Terminal. Then you can recover files from that snapshot.</p>
<p>Git is important not just for backing up and recovering files (after all, backup software such as Apple’s Time Machine can do that). You can use git with <a href="https://github.com/">GitHub</a> for remote backup of your projects. More importantly, git and GitHub are the primary mechanisms for collaborating on Rails application development, whether open source or proprietary projects. You will use git and GitHub constantly on any real-world Rails project.</p>
