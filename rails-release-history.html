Rails 3.2 was released January 20, 2012. Improvements over Rails 3.1 include faster execution in development mode. The speed of resolving routes also improved. There are many tiny (but helpful) improvements throughout the framework. Rails 3.2 deprecates plugins so you must find Ruby gems to replace any plugins used in earlier Rails projects. You can use Ruby 1.8.7 but you should use Ruby 1.9.3 or Ruby 2.0. See the "Rails 3.2.0 Announcement":http://weblog.rubyonrails.org/2012/1/20/rails-3-2-0-faster-dev-mode-routing-explain-queries-tagged-logger-store and "Ruby on Rails 3.2 Release Notes":http://guides.rubyonrails.org/3_2_release_notes.html (with upgrade instructions). There's a Railscast from Ryan Bates titiled "Upgrading to Rails 3.2":http://railscasts.com/episodes/265-rails-3-1-overview. Michael Hartl's popular Ruby on Rails Tutorial book covers Rails 3.2 ("Ruby on Rails Tutorial Version 3.2":http://ruby.railstutorial.org/ruby-on-rails-tutorial-book?version=3.2). Finally, José Valim highlights his "Five Favorite 'Hidden' features in Rails 3.2":http://blog.plataformatec.com.br/2012/01/my-five-favorite-hidden-features-in-rails-3-2/.

_What You Need to Know:_ Rails 3.2.16 is far more secure than earlier versions. If an application uses an older version of Rails, you should update to Rails 3.2.16 immediately and then begin an upgrade to Rails 4.0.

Other features include "HTTP streaming":http://railscasts.com/episodes/266-http-streaming, default jQuery, reversible migrations, mountable engines, identity map, prepared statements, Rack::Cache on by default, forced SSL, role-based mass-assignment protection, has_secure_password, and custom serializers. See the "Rails 3.1 release candidate announcement":http://weblog.rubyonrails.org/2011/5/22/rails-3-1-release-candidate for details. There's a "Rails 3.1 Overview":http://railscasts.com/episodes/265-rails-3-1-overview from Ryan Bates and a "changelog":https://gist.github.com/958283 for all the details. Yehuda Katz explains "What’s Up With All These Changes in Rails?":http://yehudakatz.com/2011/06/14/what-the-hell-is-happening-to-rails/. The best overview of Rails 3.1 is Michael Hartl's "chapter on Rails 3.1":http://ruby.railstutorial.org/chapters/rails-3-1#top in his Ruby on Rails Tutorial book.

_What You Need to Know:_ The greatest impact for developers moving from Rails 3.0 to 3.1 is the new location for CSS and JavaScript files and changes to the application layout file. See the official "Rails 3.1 Asset Pipeline guide":http://guides.rubyonrails.org/asset_pipeline.html for details.
