      <h1>Installing Rails</h1>
<h4>by Daniel Kehoe</h4>
<p><em>Last updated 3 April 2013</em></p>
<p>Installing Rails 4.0 and Rails 3.2.13 on Mac OS X, Ubuntu, or Windows. Up-to-date, detailed instructions on how to install Rails newest releases.</p>
<p>This article from the <a href="http://railsapps.github.com/">RailsApps project</a> will show you how to install Rails. It shows how to install the most recent stable release (3.2.13) and the newest version of Rails (4.0.0.beta1). With these versions on your machine, you’ll explore the new features of Rails 4.0 while continuing to develop projects with the most recent stable version.</p>
<p>The article doesn’t offer shortcuts for beginners. It is an installation guide that professional developers use to configure their working environment for real-world Rails development. For a compressed guide that covers only Rails 3.2, see the <a href="http://installfest.railsbridge.org/installfest/">RailsBridge Installfest</a> site.</p>
<h3>If You Are New to Rails</h3>
<p>If you’re new to Rails, see <a href="http://railsapps.github.com/what-is-ruby-rails.html">What is Ruby? And Rails?</a>,  recommendations for a <a href="https://tutorials.railsapps.org/rails-tutorial">Rails tutorial</a>, and a list of top resources for <a href="http://railsapps.github.com/ruby-and-rails.html">Ruby and Rails</a>.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.twitter.com/rails_apps"><img src="http://twitter-badges.s3.amazonaws.com/t_logo-a.png" title="Follow on Twitter" alt="Follow on Twitter"></a> Follow <a href="http://twitter.com/rails_apps">@rails_apps</a> on Twitter for updates and timely Rails tips.</p>
<h3>From the RailsApps Project</h3>
<p>The <a href="http://railsapps.github.com/">RailsApps project</a> provides example applications that developers use as starter apps. Hundreds of developers use the apps, report problems as they arise, and propose solutions. Rails changes frequently; each application is known to work and serves as your personal “reference implementation” so you can stay up to date. Each is accompanied by a tutorial so there is no mystery code. Maintenance and development of the RailsApps applications is supported by subscriptions to the <a href="https://tutorials.railsapps.org">RailsApps tutorials</a>.</p>
<h2>Before You Start: What’s New in Rails</h2>
<p>If you have not been closely following the evolution of the Rails platform, here’s a summary of recent developments. To stay informed of new releases, subscribe to Peter Cooper’s <a href="http://rubyweekly.com/">Ruby Weekly</a> newsletter and follow <a href="http://twitter.com/ruby_news">@ruby_news</a> or <a href="http://twitter.com/rails_apps">@rails_apps</a> on Twitter.</p>
<h4>Updating Rails Applications</h4>
<p>For instructions and advice, see the article <a href="http://railsapps.github.com/updating-rails.html">Updating Rails</a>. You should update each of your Rails applications when a new version of Rails is released. Occasionally a critical security fix is released. If you don’t update regularly, upgrading several versions at once may require considerable effort, making it difficult to resolve security vulnerabilities quickly.</p>
<p>You can easily see differences between versions of the Rails default application at the <a href="http://railsdiff.org/">railsdiff.org</a> site.</p>
<h4>Rails 4.0</h4>
<p>Rails 4.0.0.beta1 was released February 25, 2013.</p>
<p>I recommend Andy Lindeman’s ebook <a href="http://www.upgradingtorails4.com/">Upgrading to Rails 4</a> as a guide to development with Rails 4.0. You can follow the progress of Rails 4.0 development on the <a href="http://www.edgerails.info/">EdgeRails.info</a> site.</p>
<p>Ruby 2.0 is recommended for Rails 4 (Rails runs faster with Ruby 2.0). Ruby 1.9.3 will work but Ruby 1.8.7 will not.</p>
<p><em>What You Need to Know:</em> It will be several months before Rails 4 final is out. For projects deploying to production in the next few months, use Rails 3.2.13. Install Rails 4.0.0.beta1 to get familiar with the changes coming with Rails 4.</p>
<h4>Rails 3.2 Release History</h4>
<ul>
	<li>Rails 3.2.13 was released March 18, 2013 with security fixes plus patches to assure that all Rails 3.2 projects run with Ruby 2.0. See <a href="http://weblog.rubyonrails.org/2013/2/27/Rails-3-2-13-rc1-has-been-released/">Rails 3.2.13.rc1 has been released</a> and <a href="http://weblog.rubyonrails.org/2013/3/18/SEC-ANN-Rails-3-2-13-3-1-12-and-2-3-18-have-been-released/">Rails 3.2.13, 3.1.12, and 2.3.18 have been released</a>.</li>
	<li>Rails 3.2.12 was released February 11, 2013 with an “update immediately” security fix. See <a href="http://weblog.rubyonrails.org/2013/2/11/SEC-ANN-Rails-3-2-12-3-1-11-and-2-3-17-have-been-released/">Rails 3.2.12, 3.1.11, and 2.3.17 have been released</a>.</li>
	<li>Rails 3.2.11 was released January 8, 2013 with an “upgrade right now!” security fix. Security researcher <a href="https://twitter.com/hdmoore">HD Moore</a> called it, “The worst security issue that the Rails platform has seen to date” (<a href="https://community.rapid7.com/community/metasploit/blog/2013/01/10/exploiting-ruby-on-rails-with-metasploit-cve-2013-0156">details</a> and <a href="http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=5035023">discussion</a>). If you’re running any earlier version of Rails, your application and its server are vulnerable to attack and the exploit code is readily available. See <a href="http://weblog.rubyonrails.org/2013/1/8/Rails-3-2-11-3-1-10-3-0-19-and-2-3-15-have-been-released/">Rails 3.2.11, 3.1.10, 3.0.19, and 2.3.15 have been released</a> and a preliminary <a href="http://www.insinuator.net/2013/01/rails-yaml/">Analysis of Rails <span class="caps">XML</span> Parameter Parsing Vulnerability</a>.</li>
	<li>Rails 3.2.10 was released January 2, 2013 with a fix for a <a href="http://blog.phusion.nl/2013/01/03/rails-sql-injection-vulnerability-hold-your-horses-here-are-the-facts/">Rails <span class="caps">SQL</span> injection vulnerability</a>.

</li>
	<li>Rails 3.2.9 was released November 12, 2012 with many small bug fixes. See <a href="http://weblog.rubyonrails.org/2012/11/12/ann-rails-3-2-9-has-been-released/">Rails version 3.2.9 has been released</a>.</li>
	<li>Rails 3.2.8 was released August 9, 2012 with a security fix that potentially impacts all users. See <a href="http://weblog.rubyonrails.org/2012/8/9/ann-rails-3-2-8-has-been-released/">Rails version 3.2.8 has been released</a>.</li>
	<li>Rails 3.2.7 was released July 26, 2012 with a security fix for digest authentication plus various minor fixes. See <a href="http://weblog.rubyonrails.org/2012/7/26/ann-rails-3-2-7-has-been-released/">Rails version 3.2.7 has been released</a>.</li>
	<li>Rails 3.2.6 was released June 12, 2012 with two important security fixes. See <a href="http://weblog.rubyonrails.org/2012/6/12/ann-rails-3-2-6-has-been-released/">Rails version 3.2.6 has been released</a>.</li>
	<li>Rails 3.2.5 was released June 1, 2012 to correct a regression in Rails 3.2.4. See <a href="http://weblog.rubyonrails.org/2012/5/31/ann-rails-3-2-5-has-been-released/">Rails version 3.2.5 has been released</a>.</li>
	<li>Rails 3.2.4 was released May 31, 2012 with minor bug fixes plus two important security fixes. See <a href="http://weblog.rubyonrails.org/2012/5/31/ann-rails-3-2-4-has-been-released/">Rails version 3.2.4 has been released</a>.</li>
	<li>Rails 3.2.3 was released March 31, 2012 with improved protection from mass assignment vulnerabilities. See the <a href="http://weblog.rubyonrails.org/2012/3/30/ann-rails-3-2-3-has-been-released/">Rails 3.2.3 Announcement</a>.</li>
	<li>Rails 3.2.2 was released March 1, 2012 with some minor bug fixes plus two important security fixes. See the <a href="http://weblog.rubyonrails.org/2012/3/1/ann-rails-3-2-2-has-been-released">Rails 3.2.2 Announcement</a>.</li>
	<li>Rails 3.2.1 was released January 26, 2012 with some minor fixes. See <a href="https://gist.github.com/1685812">Ruby on Rails v3.2.1 Changelogs</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>What You Need to Know:</em> Use the most recent stable release of Rails because it is the most secure version.</p>
<h4>Rails 3.2</h4>
<p>Rails 3.2 was released January 20, 2012. Improvements over Rails 3.1 include faster execution in development mode. The speed of resolving routes also improved. There are many tiny (but helpful) improvements throughout the framework. Rails 3.2 deprecates plugins so you must find Ruby gems to replace any plugins used in earlier Rails projects. You can use Ruby 1.8.7 but you should use Ruby 1.9.3 or Ruby 2.0. See the <a href="http://weblog.rubyonrails.org/2012/1/20/rails-3-2-0-faster-dev-mode-routing-explain-queries-tagged-logger-store">Rails 3.2.0 Announcement</a> and <a href="http://guides.rubyonrails.org/3_2_release_notes.html">Ruby on Rails 3.2 Release Notes</a> (with upgrade instructions). There’s a Railscast from Ryan Bates titiled <a href="http://railscasts.com/episodes/265-rails-3-1-overview">Upgrading to Rails 3.2</a>. Michael Hartl’s popular Ruby on Rails Tutorial book covers Rails 3.2 (<a href="http://ruby.railstutorial.org/ruby-on-rails-tutorial-book?version=3.2">Ruby on Rails Tutorial Version 3.2</a>). Finally, José Valim highlights his <a href="http://blog.plataformatec.com.br/2012/01/my-five-favorite-hidden-features-in-rails-3-2/">Five Favorite ‘Hidden’ features in Rails 3.2</a>.</p>
<p><em>What You Need to Know:</em> Upgrading from Rails 3.1 to Rails 3.2 is easy and yields faster performance (especially in development mode). You may run into issues if your application has routing complexities (the routing engine has changed). For an older application, upgrade to Rails 3.1 before upgrading to Rails 3.2.</p>
<h4>Rails 3.1</h4>
<p>Rails 3.1.0 was released August 31, 2011. Eight release candidates were released beginning May 21, 2011. Rails 3.1 introduced the <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGdCI2HhfAU">asset pipeline</a> which enables proper organization of <span class="caps">CSS</span> and JavaScript. Other features include <a href="http://railscasts.com/episodes/266-http-streaming"><span class="caps">HTTP</span> streaming</a>, default jQuery, reversible migrations, mountable engines, identity map, prepared statements, Rack::Cache on by default, forced <span class="caps">SSL</span>, role-based mass-assignment protection, has_secure_password, and custom serializers. See the <a href="http://weblog.rubyonrails.org/2011/5/22/rails-3-1-release-candidate">Rails 3.1 release candidate announcement</a> for details. There’s a <a href="http://railscasts.com/episodes/265-rails-3-1-overview">Rails 3.1 Overview</a> from Ryan Bates and a <a href="https://gist.github.com/958283">changelog</a> for all the details. Yehuda Katz explains <a href="http://yehudakatz.com/2011/06/14/what-the-hell-is-happening-to-rails/">What’s Up With All These Changes in Rails?</a>. The best overview of Rails 3.1 is Michael Hartl’s <a href="http://ruby.railstutorial.org/chapters/rails-3-1#top">chapter on Rails 3.1</a> in his Ruby on Rails Tutorial book.</p>
<p><em>What You Need to Know:</em> The greatest impact for developers moving from Rails 3.0 to 3.1 is the new location for <span class="caps">CSS</span> and JavaScript files and changes to the application layout file. See the official <a href="http://guides.rubyonrails.org/asset_pipeline.html">Rails 3.1 Asset Pipeline guide</a> for details.</p>
<h2>Getting Started</h2>
<p>For Mac OS X or Ubuntu Linux, it is best to install <span class="caps">RVM</span>, the <a href="https://rvm.io/">Ruby Version Manager</a>, to install Ruby and Rails. For Windows, you’ll need to use an installation program such as RailsInstaller.</p>
<p>There are alternatives to <span class="caps">RVM</span> for switching between versions of Ruby (see a list below including chruby and rbenv) but <span class="caps">RVM</span> is popular, well-supported, and full-featured.</p>
<h3>Mac</h3>
<p>Mac OS X provides a pre-installed Ruby 1.8.7 version. You must install a newer version of Ruby for developing with Rails.</p>
<p>The newest version of <span class="caps">RVM</span> provides almost everything needed to set up the components needed to install Ruby and Rails. You may see advice elsewhere to use an installation program such as RailsInstaller to set up everything. These installation programs are no longer needed as <span class="caps">RVM</span> will set up components needed to install Ruby. I don’t recommend RailsInstaller for experienced developers as it installs <span class="caps">RVM</span> at the system level (for all users, not in your user directory) and seldom provides the newest versions of Ruby or Rails.</p>
<p>On Mac OS X you will need a C language compiler to install Ruby and gems that require native extensions. Install Apple’s <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/9329243/xcode-4-4-command-line-tools">Xcode Command Line Tools</a> to get the correct C language compiler before you install <span class="caps">RVM</span>.</p>
<p><em>What You Need to Know:</em> Use <span class="caps">RVM</span> to install Ruby and Rails. First install Apple’s Xcode Command Line Tools. Use the RailsInstaller utility if you have trouble with <span class="caps">RVM</span>.</p>
<h3>Ubuntu Linux</h3>
<p>On Ubuntu, package managers are available to install Ruby. The package managers are often not up to date. Use <span class="caps">RVM</span> instead.</p>
<p>Since Rails 3.1, a JavaScript runtime has been needed for development on Ubuntu Linux (it is not needed for Mac OS X or Windows). For development on Ubuntu Linux it is best to install the <a href="http://nodejs.org/">Node.js</a> server-side JavaScript environment:</p>
<pre>
$ sudo apt-get install nodejs
</pre>
<p>and set it in your <code>$PATH</code>.</p>
<p>If you don’t install Node.js, you’ll need to add this to the Gemfile for each Rails application you build:</p>
<pre>
gem 'therubyracer'
</pre>
<p><em>What You Need to Know:</em> Use <span class="caps">RVM</span> to install Ruby and Rails. And install a JavaScript runtime.</p>
<h3>Windows</h3>
<p>You can develop with Rails on Windows but be aware that most developers use Mac OS X or Ubuntu to develop Rails applications. Some gems requiring native extensions may be difficult to install on Windows.</p>
<p>See instructions for <a href="http://installfest.railsbridge.org/installfest/windows">Installing Rails on Windows</a> from the <a href="http://railsbridge.org/">Railsbridge Workshops</a>. The instructions recommend using <a href="http://railsinstaller.org/">RailsInstaller for Windows</a>. RailsInstaller includes a “DevKit” which installs gcc and other Unix build tools. Also see Amit Kazmirsky’s <a href="http://amitkazmirsky.com/2013/01/03/installing-rails-with-mysql-on-windows-8">Installing Rails with MySQL on Windows 8</a> for important tips. On Windows, use <a href="http://github.com/vertiginous/pik">Pik</a> for services similar to <span class="caps">RVM</span>.</p>
<p>Another option on Windows is to install Ruby under <a href="http://www.cygwin.com/">Cygwin</a>. This gives you a Linux environment on Windows. Make sure you have the following Cygwin packages installed: git, readline, wget, patch, make, gcc, libsqlite3-devel, libxml2-devel, libxslt-devel.</p>
<p><em>What You Need to Know:</em> Switch to Mac OS X, Ubuntu Linux, or Cygwin if you can. You’ll avoid many headaches.</p>
<h2>Install Ruby Using <span class="caps">RVM</span>
</h2>
<p>Use <span class="caps">RVM</span>, the <a href="https://rvm.io/">Ruby Version Manager</a>, to install Ruby and manage your Rails versions. <span class="caps">RVM</span> will install Ruby 2.0 and make it easy to switch between Rails 3.2 and Rails 4.0. You’ll use <span class="caps">RVM</span> to create a project-specific gemset for each application you build.</p>
<p>Ruby may already be installed on your computer. You should install the newest version of Ruby. If you have an older version of Ruby installed you don’t need to remove it. <span class="caps">RVM</span> will leave your system version of Ruby untouched and use your shell to intercept any calls to Ruby. Any older Ruby and Rails versions will remain on your system and the <span class="caps">RVM</span> version will take precedence.</p>
<p>On Mac OS X, you’ll need to install Apple’s <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/9329243/xcode-4-4-command-line-tools">Xcode Command Line Tools</a> before installing <span class="caps">RVM</span>.</p>
<p>The <span class="caps">RVM</span> website explains <a href="https://rvm.io/rvm/install/">how to install <span class="caps">RVM</span></a>. <span class="caps">RVM</span> includes an “autolibs” option to identify and install components needed for your operating system. See the article <a href="https://blog.engineyard.com/2013/rvm-ruby-2-0"><span class="caps">RVM</span> Autolibs: Automatic Dependency Handling and Ruby 2.0</a> for more information.</p>
<pre>
$ \curl -L https://get.rvm.io | bash -s stable --autolibs=enable --ruby
</pre>
<p>Note the backslash before “curl” (this avoids potential version conflicts).</p>
<p>The “—ruby” flag will install the newest version of Ruby. Ruby 2.0 patch level 0 was current when this was written. You can check for the current <a href="http://www.ruby-lang.org/en/downloads/">recommended version of Ruby</a>.</p>
<p>If you already have <span class="caps">RVM</span> installed, update it to the latest version and install Ruby:</p>
<pre>
$ rvm get stable --autolibs=enable
$ rvm install ruby-2.0.0
$ rvm --default use ruby-2.0.0
</pre>
<p>To start using <span class="caps">RVM</span>, you can either close and reopen your terminal windows or run:</p>
<pre>
$ source ~/.rvm/scripts/rvm
</pre>
<h4>Troubleshooting</h4>
<p>If you get OpenSSL errors, make sure you are using RubyGems 2.0.3 or newer:</p>
<pre>
$ gem -v
</pre>
<p>Use <code>gem update --system</code> to upgrade the RubyGems system gem if necessary.</p>
<p>For more help, see the article <a href="http://railsapps.github.com/openssl-certificate-verify-failed.html">OpenSSL Errors and Rails</a>.</p>
<p>If you get OpenSSL errors after <span class="caps">RVM</span> is installed, you may need to remove and reinstall <span class="caps">RVM</span>. Use <code>rvm implode</code> to remove <span class="caps">RVM</span>. Check that <span class="caps">RVM</span> has been removed with <code>rvm -v</code>. If it’s still there, it may be installed at the system level for multiple users. This happens if you’ve previously used RailsInstaller (you’ll need to remove RailsInstaller with <code>open /Applications/RailsInstallerOSX-Uninstaller.app</code>).</p>
<p>If <span class="caps">RVM</span> installs successfully but installation of Ruby fails, try:</p>
<pre>
$ rvm requirements
</pre>
<p>If Ruby installation succeeds but Ruby 2.0 is not the default when you open a new terminal window, try updating the <span class="caps">RVM</span> loading code:</p>
<pre>
$ rvm get stable --auto-dotfiles
</pre>
<p>It is also helpful to check <span class="caps">RVM</span> notes:</p>
<pre>
$ rvm notes
</pre>
<p>For more information about RVM’s automatic detection and installation of system components, see:</p>
<pre>
$ rvm help autolibs
</pre>
<p>You can get help directly from the <span class="caps">RVM</span> team using the <span class="caps">IRC</span> (Internet Relay Chat) channel #rvm on irc.freenode.net:</p>
<ul>
	<li><a href="http://webchat.freenode.net/?channels=rvm">http://webchat.freenode.net/?channels=rvm</a></li>
</ul>
<p>If you’ve never used <span class="caps">IRC</span>, it’s worthwhile to figure out how to use <span class="caps">IRC</span> because the <span class="caps">RVM</span> team is helpful and friendly. <span class="caps">IRC</span> on freenode requires registration (see <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:IRC/Tutorial#Nickname_registration">how to register</a>).</p>
<h4>RailsInstaller and Alternatives</h4>
<p>If you have problems installing <span class="caps">RVM</span>, you can try one of the installation programs that provide pre-assembled packages:</p>
<ul>
	<li><a href="http://railsinstaller.org/">RailsInstaller.org</a></li>
	<li><a href="http://www.atmos.org/cinderella/">Cinderella</a></li>
	<li><a href="http://bitnami.org/stack/rubystack">BitNami RubyStack</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Before using RailsInstaller, be sure to remove <span class="caps">RVM</span> with <code>rvm implode</code> (or else the single-user version of <span class="caps">RVM</span> will hide the multi-user version of <span class="caps">RVM</span> installed by RailsInstaller).</p>
<p>If you want to use RailsInstaller on Mac OS X, you should use the newer version available (it contains Ruby 2.0):</p>
<p><a href="http://railsinstaller.s3.amazonaws.com/list.html">http://railsinstaller.s3.amazonaws.com/list.html</a></p>
<p>See instructions for <a href="http://installfest.railsbridge.org/installfest/">Installing Rails</a> from the <a href="http://railsbridge.org/">Railsbridge Workshops</a> if you use RailsInstaller.</p>
<p>If you are a student or hobbyist and you do not intend to release a Rails project to production, you can use older versions of Ruby or Rails provided by RailsInstaller. If you have plans to release a Rails project to production (that is, to deploy it where others can use it), you should use <span class="caps">RVM</span> to update to Ruby 2.0 (it is faster) and you <em>must</em> update Rails (versions before 3.2.13 have significant security vulnerabilities).</p>
<p>If you decide to remove RailsInstaller, use <code>open /Applications/RailsInstallerOSX-Uninstaller.app</code>. It is important to remove RailsInstaller before installing <span class="caps">RVM</span> because RailsInstaller installs an older version of <span class="caps">RVM</span> at the system level and (by default) a new install of <span class="caps">RVM</span> will install at the user level.</p>
<h4>Alternatives to <span class="caps">RVM</span>
</h4>
<p>Not everyone likes the shell management approach of <span class="caps">RVM</span>. If you are an experienced Unix administrator, you may prefer one of the many alternatives to <span class="caps">RVM</span>.</p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/postmodern/chruby">Chruby</a> provides a streamlined utility for switching between Ruby versions.</p>
<p>Sam Stephenson offers an alternative to <span class="caps">RVM</span> named <a href="https://github.com/sstephenson/rbenv">rbenv</a>. With rbenv, use Jamis Buck’s <a href="https://github.com/jamis">rbenv-gemset</a> to switch between gemsets. The utilities rbenv and rbenv-gemset are less “magic” than <span class="caps">RVM</span> and can be useful if you encounter issues with <span class="caps">RVM</span>. If you want to try rbenv, see notes for <a href="https://gist.github.com/1859298">installing Ruby on MacOS X 10.7.3 with XCode 4.3 and rbenv</a>.</p>
<p>There are many more alternatives to <span class="caps">RVM</span> <a href="https://github.com/wayneeseguin/rvm/blob/master/help/alt.md">on this list</a>.</p>
<h4>Alternative Rubies</h4>
<p><span class="caps">MRI</span>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ruby_MRI">Matz’s Ruby Interpreter</a>, is the reference implementation. It is the default when you install Ruby 2.0 using <span class="caps">RVM</span>. There are other Ruby interpreters available for specialized use:</p>
<ul>
	<li><a href="http://jruby.org/">JRuby</a></li>
	<li><a href="http://www.rubyenterpriseedition.com/"><span class="caps">REE</span></a></li>
	<li><a href="http://rubini.us/">Rubinius</a></li>
	<li><a href="http://maglev.github.com/">MagLev</a></li>
	<li><a href="http://www.macruby.org/">MacRuby</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Run <code>rvm list known</code> for a full list. Any can be installed using <span class="caps">RVM</span>.</p>
<h2>RVM’s Global Gemset</h2>
<p>Installing Ruby with <span class="caps">RVM</span> creates a default “global” gemset.</p>
<p>To see a list of the gemsets you have installed:</p>
<pre>
$ rvm gemset list
</pre>
<p>With a new installation of Ruby (using <span class="caps">RVM</span>), you’ll see just one gemset.</p>
<p>See what gems are installed in the “global” gemset:</p>
<pre>
$ rvm gemset use global
$ gem list
</pre>
<p>Several gems are installed with Ruby:</p>
<ul>
	<li>bigdecimal</li>
	<li>bundler</li>
	<li>io-console</li>
	<li>json</li>
	<li>minitest</li>
	<li>psych</li>
	<li>rake</li>
	<li>rdoc</li>
	<li>test-unit</li>
</ul>
<p><span class="caps">RVM</span> installs two additional gems:</p>
<ul>
	<li>rubygems-bundler</li>
	<li>rvm</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="gems">What’s New in Gems</h2>
<p>A trouble-free development environment requires the newest versions of these gems. If you’ve just installed Ruby, you’ll have newest gems. If you are using a previous installation of Ruby, these gems may need updating. Check before installing Rails.</p>
<p>You should have:</p>
<ul>
	<li>RubyGems 2.0.3 — <a href="https://rubygems.org/gems/rubygems-update">newest RubyGems system gem</a>
</li>
	<li>Rake 10.0.4 — <a href="http://rubygems.org/gems/rake">newest Rake gem</a>
</li>
	<li>Bundler 1.3.4 — <a href="https://rubygems.org/gems/bundler">newest Bundler gem</a>
</li>
	<li>Rubygems-Bundler 1.1.1 — <a href="http://rubygems.org/gems/rubygems-bundler">newest version of Rubygems-Bundler</a>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Check the RubyGems system gem version:</p>
<pre>
$ gem -v
</pre>
<p>Be sure you have installed RubyGems 2.0.3 or newer. With older versions, you may have trouble with OpenSSL and Ruby 2.0.</p>
<p>Use <code>gem update --system</code> to upgrade the RubyGems system gem.</p>
<p>Check for current versions of other gems:</p>
<pre>
$ gem list
</pre>
<p>Use <code>gem update rake</code> to upgrade Rake.</p>
<p>Use <code>gem update bundler</code> to upgrade Bundler.</p>
<p>Use <code>gem update rubygems-bundler</code> to upgrade Rubygems-Bundler.</p>
<p>You can track updates to gems by creating an account at RubyGems.org and visiting your <a href="https://rubygems.org/dashboard">dashboard</a>. Search for each gem you use and “subscribe” to see a feed of updates in the dashboard (an <span class="caps">RSS</span> feed is available from the dashboard). As an alternative, use the <a href="https://gemnasium.com/">Gemnasium</a> service which surveys your GitHub repo and sends email notifications when gem versions change. Gemnasium is free for public repositories with a premium plan for private repositories.</p>
<h2>Rails Installation Options</h2>
<p>Check for the <a href="http://rubygems.org/gems/rails">current version of Rails</a>.</p>
<p>If you want, you can install Rails directly into the global gemset. However, many developers prefer to keep the global gemset sparse and install Rails into project-specific gemsets. It’s advisable to create a new gemset for each application you build.</p>
<p>Before we do that, let’s consider the options you have for installing Rails.</p>
<p>If you want the most recent stable release:</p>
<pre>
$ gem install rails
$ rails -v
</pre>
<p>If you want the newest beta version or release candidate, you can install with <code>--pre</code>.</p>
<pre>
$ gem install rails --pre
$ rails -v
</pre>
<p>Or you can get a specific version (just in case the newest version is broken).</p>
<p>For example, if you want the Rails 4.0.0.beta1 release:</p>
<pre>
$ gem install rails --version=4.0.0.beta1
$ rails -v
</pre>
<h2>Create Gemsets for Existing Applications</h2>
<p>If you have existing Rails applications running under Ruby 1.9.3, you’ll need an <span class="caps">RVM</span> Ruby and gemset for Ruby 1.9.3 and Rails 3.2.13, the most recent stable release of Rails. Ruby 1.9.3 patch level 392 was the most recent secure release before Ruby 2.0.</p>
<pre>
$ rvm install ruby-1.9.3-p392
$ rvm use ruby-1.9.3-p392@Rails3.2.13 --create
$ rvm gemset list
</pre>
<p>When you want to work with an existing Rails application, switch to the ruby-1.9.3-p392@Rails3.2.13 gemset:</p>
<pre>
$ rvm use ruby-1.9.3-p392@Rails3.2.13
</pre>
<p>You should begin testing any existing Rails applications with Ruby 2.0. You should create a new gemset for Ruby 2.0 and Rails 3.2.13, the most recent release of Rails patched to work with Ruby 2.0. Here’s how, assuming you’ve already installed Ruby 2.0:</p>
<pre>
$ rvm use ruby-2.0.0
$ rvm use ruby-2.0.0@Rails3.2.13 --create
$ rvm gemset list
$ gem install rails --version=3.2.13
$ gem list
</pre>
<p>When you want to test an existing Rails application with Ruby 2.0, switch to the ruby-2.0.0@Rails3.2.13 gemset:</p>
<pre>
$ rvm use ruby-2.0.0@Rails3.2.13
</pre>
<p>Change the application’s Gemfile to specify <code>gem 'rails', '3.2.13'</code> and run <code>bundle update</code> to test the application with Ruby 2.0 and Rails 3.2.13.</p>
<p>To begin migrating existing projects to Rails 4.0, you can create another gemset:</p>
<pre>
$ rvm use ruby-2.0.0
$ rvm use ruby-2.0.0@Rails4.0.0 --create
$ rvm gemset list
$ gem install rails --pre
$ gem list
</pre>
<p>For advice about migrating an application from Rails 3.2 to Rails 4.0, see Andy Lindeman’s ebook <a href="http://www.upgradingtorails4.com/">Upgrading to Rails 4</a>.</p>
<p>Next we’ll look at creating new Rails 3.2 and Rails 4.0 projects using Ruby 2.0.</p>
<h2>New Projects with Rails 3.2 and Ruby 2.0</h2>
<p>Here’s how to create a project-specific gemset and install Rails 3.2.13, the most recent release of Rails patched to work with Ruby 2.0.</p>
<p>Instead of installing Rails into the global gemset and running <code>rails new</code>, we’ll create a root directory for a new application, create a new gemset, install Rails, and then generate a starter application.</p>
<pre>
$ mkdir myRails32app
$ cd myRails32app
$ rvm use ruby-2.0.0@myRails32app --ruby-version --create
$ gem install rails --version=3.2.13
$ rails new .
</pre>
<p>We’ll name the new application “myRails32app.” Obviously, you can give it any name you like.</p>
<p>With this workflow, you’ll first create a root directory for your application. Then with one command you can create a new project-specific gemset. With the new gemset in place, you’ll next install Rails and create a new Rails application. Notice that you use the Unix “dot convention” to specify that you want to build the application in the current directory.</p>
<p>The option “—ruby-version” creates <strong>.ruby-version</strong> and <strong>.ruby-gemset</strong> files in the root directory. <span class="caps">RVM</span> recognizes these files in an application’s root directory and loads the required version of Ruby and the correct gemset whenever you enter the directory.</p>
<p>When we create the gemset, it will be empty (though it inherits use of all the gems in the global gemset). We immediately install Rails. The command <code>gem install rails --version=3.2.13</code> installs the most recent release of Rails patched to work with Ruby 2.0, which was version 3.2.13 at the time this was written.</p>
<p>Finally we run <code>rails new .</code>. We use the Unix “dot” convention to refer to the current directory. This assigns the name of the directory to the new application.</p>
<p>This approach is different from the way most beginners are taught to create a Rails application. Most instructions suggest using <code>rails new myRails32app</code> to generate a new application and then enter the directory to begin work. Our approach makes it easy to create a project-specific gemset and install Rails before the application is created.</p>
<p>The <code>rails new</code> command generates the default Rails starter app. If you wish, you can use the <a href="http://railsapps.github.com/rails-composer/">Rails Composer</a> tool to generate a starter application with a choice of basic features and popular gems.</p>
<p>Here’s how to generate a new Rails application using the Rails Composer tool:</p>
<pre>
$ mkdir myRails32app
$ cd myRails32app
$ rvm use ruby-2.0.0@myRails32app --ruby-version --create
$ gem install rails --version=3.2.13
$ rails new . -m https://raw.github.com/RailsApps/rails-composer/master/composer.rb
</pre>
<p>See below for a list of starter applications from the RailsApps project.</p>
<h4>Quick Test</h4>
<p>For a “smoke test” to see if everything runs, display a list of Rake tasks.</p>
<pre>
$ rake -T
</pre>
<p>There’s no need to run <code>bundle exec rake</code> instead of <code>rake</code> when you are using <span class="caps">RVM</span> (see <a href="https://rvm.io/integration/bundler/"><span class="caps">RVM</span> and bundler integration</a>).</p>
<h2>New Projects with Rails 4.0 and Ruby 2.0</h2>
<p>Now let’s create a project-specific gemset and install the pre-release version of Rails 4.0.</p>
<p>This can be a Rails application that you use to become familiar with the features of Rails 4.0.</p>
<pre>
$ mkdir myRails4app
$ cd myRails4app
$ rvm use ruby-2.0.0@myRails4app --ruby-version --create
$ gem install rails --pre
$ rails new .
</pre>
<p>We’ll name the new application “myRails4app.” Obviously, you can give it any name you like.</p>
<p>As of this writing, there are no Rails 4.0 starter applications from the RailsApps project.</p>
<p>This concludes the instructions for installing Ruby and Rails. Read on for additional advice and tips.</p>
<h2>Databases for Rails</h2>
<p>Rails uses the <a href="http://www.sqlite.org/">SQLite</a> database by default. Mac OS X come with SQLite pre-installed and there’s nothing to configure. On Windows, if you use a pre-assembled package to install Rails, it will likely have SQLite pre-installed.</p>
<p>On Ubuntu Linux, install SQLite with:</p>
<pre>
$ sudo apt-get install sqlite3 libsqlite3-dev
</pre>
<p>Though SQLite is adequate for development (and even some production applications), a new Rails application can be configured for other databases. The command <code>rails new myapp --database=</code> will show you a list of supported databases.</p>
<pre>
Supported for preconfiguration are: mysql, oracle, postgresql, sqlite3, frontbase, ibm_db, sqlserver, jdbcmysql, jdbcsqlite3, jdbcpostgresql, jdbc.
</pre>
<p>For example, to create a new Rails application to use <a href="http://www.postgresql.org/">PostgreSQL</a>:</p>
<pre>
$ rails new myapp --database=postgresql
</pre>
<p>The <code>--database=postgresql</code> parameter will add the pg database adapter gem to the Gemfile and create a suitable config/database.yml file. Here’s an article that explains how to install PostgreSQL on Mac OS X:</p>
<ul>
	<li><a href="http://russbrooks.com/2010/11/25/install-postgresql-9-on-os-x">Install PostgreSQL 9 on OS X</a></li>
</ul>
<h2>Rails Starter Apps</h2>
<p>The starter application you created with <code>rails new</code> is very basic.</p>
<p>Use the <a href="http://railsapps.github.com/rails-composer/">Rails Composer</a> tool to build a full-featured Rails starter app.</p>
<p>You’ll get a choice of starter applications with basic features and popular gems.</p>
<p>Create a starter app using the Rails Composer application template.</p>
<p>From within an empty application root directory:</p>
<pre>
$ rails new . -m https://raw.github.com/RailsApps/rails-composer/master/composer.rb
</pre>
<p>Or, using the more conventional approach:</p>
<pre>
$ rails new myapp -m https://raw.github.com/RailsApps/rails-composer/master/composer.rb
</pre>
<p>You can add the <code>-T</code> flags to skip Test::Unit if you are using RSpec for testing.</p>
<p>You can add the <code>-O</code> flags to skip Active Record if you are using a NoSQL datastore such as MongoDB.</p>
<h4>Rails Tutorials and Example Applications</h4>
<p>The <a href="http://railsapps.github.com/">RailsApps project</a> provides example apps that show how real-world Rails applications are built. Each example is known to work and can serve as your personal “reference implementation”. Each is an open source project. Dozens of developers use the apps, report problems as they arise, and propose solutions as GitHub issues. There is a tutorial for each one so there is no mystery code.</p>

<h2>Git</h2>
<p>You should set up your application with a source control repository using git. If you are developing with Rails, <a href="http://git-scm.com/">git</a> is an essential tool. Use git to roll back code changes as needed, when you are collaborating with others, and when you must deploy an app for hosting with a service such as Heroku. See the article:</p>
<ul>
	<li><a href="http://railsapps.github.com/rails-git.html">Rails with Git and GitHub</a></li>
</ul>
<p>If git is installed on your computer and you’ve used a RailsApps application template to create your starter app, you’ll already have a git repository.</p>
<h2>Adding a Gemset to an Existing Application</h2>
<p>If you’ve already created an application with the command <code>rails new myapp</code>, you can still create a project-specific gemset. Here’s how to create a gemset for an application named “myapp” and create  <strong>.ruby-version</strong> and <strong>.ruby-gemset</strong> files in the application’s root directory:</p>
<pre>
$ rvm use ruby-2.0.0@myapp --ruby-version --create
</pre>
<p>You’ll need to install Rails and the gems listed in your Gemfile into the new gemset by running:</p>
<pre>
$ gem install rails
$ bundle install
</pre>
<h3>Specifying a Gemset for an Existing Application</h3>
<p>If you have already created both an application and a gemset, but not <strong>.ruby-version</strong> and <strong>.ruby-gemset</strong> files, here’s how to add the files. For example, if you want to use an existing gemset named “ruby-2.0.0@myapp”:</p>
<pre>
$ echo "ruby-2.0.0" &gt; .ruby-version
$ echo "myapp" &gt; .ruby-gemset
</pre>
<p>Using <strong>.ruby-version</strong> and <strong>.ruby-gemset</strong> files means you’ll automatically be using the correct Rails and gem version when you switch to your application root directory on your local machine.</p>
<h2>Deployment</h2>
<p>If you wish to run your own servers, you can deploy a Rails application using <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capistrano">Capistrano</a> deployment scripts. However, unless system administration is a personal passion, it is much easier to deploy your application with a “platform as a service” provider such as Heroku.</p>
<h3>Hosting</h3>
<p>For easy deployment, use a “platform as a service” provider such as:</p>
<ul>
	<li><a href="http://www.heroku.com/">Heroku</a></li>
	<li><a href="http://www.cloudfoundry.com/">CloudFoundry</a></li>
	<li><a href="http://www.engineyard.com/">EngineYard</a></li>
	<li><a href="https://openshift.redhat.com/app/">OpenShift</a></li>
</ul>
<p>For deployment on Heroku, see the article:</p>
<ul>
	<li><a href="http://railsapps.github.com/rails-heroku-tutorial.html">Rails on Heroku</a></li>
</ul>
<h2>Security</h2>
<p>By design, Rails encourages practices that avoid common web application vulnerabilities. The Rails security team actively investigates and patches vulnerabilities. If you use the most current version of Rails, you will be protected from known vulnerabilities. See the <a href="http://guides.rubyonrails.org/security.html">Ruby On Rails Security Guide</a> for an overview of potential issues and watch the <a href="https://groups.google.com/forum/?fromgroups#!forum/rubyonrails-security">Ruby on Rails Security Mailing List</a> for announcements and discussion.</p>
<h3>Your Application’s Secret Token</h3>
<p>Rails uses a session store to provide persistence between page requests. The default session store uses cookies. To prevent decoding of cookie data and hijacking a session, Rails encypts cookie data using a secret key. When you create a new Rails application using the <code>rails new</code> command, a unique secret key is generated and written to the <strong>config/initializers/secret_token.rb</strong> file. If you’ve generated a Rails application and committed it only to a private GitHub repository, you do not need to change the secret key. However, if you’ve cloned a public GitHub repository or made your application publicly available on GitHub, you must change the secret key when you deploy. The command <code>rake secret</code> generates a new random secret you can use. The command won’t install the key; you have to copy the key from the console output to the <strong>config/initializers/secret_token.rb</strong> file. Remember, you should never deploy an application to production that uses a publicly available secret token (obviously, it is not secret if it is public!).</p>
<h2>Troubleshooting</h2>
<h4>Problems with “Segmentation Fault”</h4>
<p>If you get a “segfault” when you try <code>rails new</code>, try removing and reinstalling <span class="caps">RVM</span>. If you are not using the current version of Mac OS X, you should upgrade before installing <span class="caps">RVM</span>.</p>
<h4>Problems with “Gem::RemoteFetcher::FetchError: SSL_connect”</h4>
<p>Ruby and RubyGems (starting with Ruby 1.9.3p194 and RubyGems 1.8.23) require verification of server <span class="caps">SSL</span> certificates when Ruby makes an Internet connection via https. If you run <code>rails new</code> and get an error “Gem::RemoteFetcher::FetchError: SSL_connect returned=1 errno=0 state=SSLv3 read server certificate” see this article suggesting solutions: <a href="http://railsapps.github.com/openssl-certificate-verify-failed.html">OpenSSL errors and Rails</a>.</p>
<h4>Problems with “Certificate Verify Failed”</h4>
<p>Are you getting an error “OpenSSL certificate verify failed” when you try to generate a new Rails app from an application template? See this article suggesting solutions: <a href="http://railsapps.github.com/openssl-certificate-verify-failed.html">OpenSSL errors and Rails</a>.</p>
